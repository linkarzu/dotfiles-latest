#: Allow other programs to control kitty. If you turn this on, other
#: programs can control all aspects of kitty, including sending text
#: to kitty windows, opening new windows, closing windows, reading the
#: content of windows, etc. Note that this even works over SSH
#: connections. The default setting of no prevents any form of remote
#: control. The meaning of the various values are:
#: password
#:     Remote control requests received over both the TTY device and the socket
#:     are confirmed based on passwords, see remote_control_password.
#: socket-only
#:     Remote control requests received over a socket are accepted
#:     unconditionally. Requests received over the TTY are denied.
#:     See listen_on.
#: socket
#:     Remote control requests received over a socket are accepted
#:     unconditionally. Requests received over the TTY are confirmed based on
#:     password.
#: no
#:     Remote control is completely disabled.
#: yes
#:     Remote control requests are always accepted.
# NOTE: Enable remote control so external programs (e.g. sketchybar) can query Kitty.
# The 'listen_on' directive below is ignored unless this is set to 'yes', 'socket', or 'socket-only'.
allow_remote_control yes

# I was getting the error

#: Listen to the specified socket for remote control connections. Note
#: that this will apply to all kitty instances. It can be overridden
#: by the kitty --listen-on command line option. For UNIX sockets,
#: such as unix:${TEMP}/mykitty or unix:@mykitty (on Linux).
#: Environment variables are expanded and relative paths are resolved
#: with respect to the temporary directory. If {kitty_pid} is present,
#: then it is replaced by the PID of the kitty process, otherwise the
#: PID of the kitty process is appended to the value, with a hyphen.
#: For TCP sockets such as tcp:localhost:0 a random port is always
#: used even if a non-zero port number is specified.  See the help for
#: kitty --listen-on for more details. Note that this will be ignored
#: unless allow_remote_control is set to either: yes, socket or
#: socket-only. Changing this option by reloading the config is not
#: supported.
# NOTE: Create a UNIX socket for remote control. This lets external scripts (like
# sketchybar) run `kitten @ --to unix:/tmp/kitty-<pid>` and retrieve titles.
# The actual socket will be created as /tmp/kitty-<pid>.

#: Ask for confirmation when closing an OS window or a tab with at
#: least this number of kitty windows in it by window manager (e.g.
#: clicking the window close button or pressing the operating system
#: shortcut to close windows) or by the close_tab action. A value of
#: zero disables confirmation. This confirmation also applies to
#: requests to quit the entire application (all OS windows, via the
#: quit action). Negative values are converted to positive ones,
#: however, with shell_integration enabled, using negative values
#: means windows sitting at a shell prompt are not counted, only
#: windows where some command is currently running. Note that if you
#: want confirmation when closing individual windows, you can map the
#: close_window_with_confirmation action.
confirm_os_window_close 0

#: The audio bell. Useful to disable it in environments that require

enable_audio_bell no

#: Use the Option key as an Alt key on macOS. With this set to no,
#: kitty will use the macOS native Option+Key to enter Unicode
#: character behavior. This will break any Alt+Key keyboard shortcuts
#: in your terminal programs, but you can use the macOS Unicode input
#: technique. You can use the values: left, right or both to use only
#: the left, right or both Option keys as Alt, instead. Note that
#: kitty itself always treats Option the same as Alt. This means you
#: cannot use this option to configure different kitty shortcuts for
#: Option+Key vs. Alt+Key. Also, any kitty shortcuts using
#: Option/Alt+Key will take priority, so that any such key presses
#: will not be passed to terminal programs running inside kitty.
#: Changing this option by reloading the config is not supported.
macos_option_as_alt right

# NOTE: The neovide cursor type in kitty came during a YouTube livestream by 
# user "Carlos Medina"
#
#: The cursor shape can be one of block, beam, underline. Note that
#: when reloading the config this will be changed only if the cursor
#: shape has not been set by the program running in the terminal. This
#: sets the default cursor shape, applications running in the terminal
#: can override it. In particular, shell integration
#: <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/shell-integration/> in kitty sets
#: the cursor shape to beam at shell prompts. You can avoid this by
#: setting shell_integration to no-cursor.
cursor_shape beam

#: The thickness of the beam cursor (in pts).
cursor_beam_thickness 1.5

#: The thickness of the underline cursor (in pts).
cursor_underline_thickness 2.0

#: The interval to blink the cursor (in seconds). Set to zero to
#: disable blinking. Negative values mean use system default. Note
#: that the minimum interval will be limited to repaint_delay.
cursor_blink_interval 0

#: Stop blinking cursor after the specified number of seconds of
#: keyboard inactivity. Set to zero to never stop blinking.
cursor_stop_blinking_after 0

# Set this to a value larger than zero to enable a “cursor trail” animation. This is an animation that shows a “trail” following the movement of the text cursor. It makes it easy to follow large cursor jumps and makes for a cool visual effect of the cursor zooming around the screen. The actual value of this option controls when the animation is triggered. It is a number of milliseconds. The trail animation only follows cursors that have stayed in their position for longer than the specified number of milliseconds. This prevents trails from appearing for cursors that rapidly change their positions during UI updates in complex applications. See cursor_trail_decay to control the animation speed and cursor_trail_start_threshold to control when a cursor trail is started.
cursor_trail 1

# Controls the decay times for the cursor trail effect when the cursor_trail is enabled. This option accepts two positive float values specifying the fastest and slowest decay times in seconds. The first value corresponds to the fastest decay time (minimum), and the second value corresponds to the slowest decay time (maximum). The second value must be equal to or greater than the first value. Smaller values result in a faster decay of the cursor trail. Adjust these values to control how quickly the cursor trail fades away.
# cursor_trail_decay 0.1 0.6
cursor_trail_decay 0.1 0.4

# Set the distance threshold for starting the cursor trail. This option accepts a positive integer value that represents the minimum number of cells the cursor must move before the trail is started. When the cursor moves less than this threshold, the trail is skipped, reducing unnecessary cursor trail animation.
cursor_trail_start_threshold 0

#: The opacity of the background. A number between zero and one, where
#: one is opaque and zero is fully transparent. This will only work if
#: supported by the OS (for instance, when using a compositor under
#: X11). Note that it only sets the background color's opacity in
#: cells that have the same background color as the default terminal
#: background, so that things like the status bar in vim, powerline
#: prompts, etc. still look good. But it means that if you use a color
#: theme with a background color in your editor, it will not be
#: rendered as transparent. Instead you should change the default
#: background color in your kitty config and not use a background
#: color in the editor color scheme. Or use the escape codes to set
#: the terminals default colors in a shell script to launch your
#: editor. See also transparent_background_colors. Be aware that using
#: a value less than 1.0 is a (possibly significant) performance hit.
#: When using a low value for this setting, it is desirable that you
#: set the background color to a color the matches the general color
#: of the desktop background, for best text rendering. Note that to
#: workaround window managers not doing gamma-corrected blending kitty
#: makes background_opacity non-linear which means, especially for
#: light backgrounds you might need to make the value much lower than
#: you expect to get good results, see 6218
#: <https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/6218> for details.

#: If you want to dynamically change transparency of windows, set
#: dynamic_background_opacity to yes (this is off by default as it has
#: a performance cost). Changing this option when reloading the config
#: will only work if dynamic_background_opacity was enabled in the
#: original config.
background_opacity 0.85

#: Set to a positive value to enable background blur (blurring of the
#: visuals behind a transparent window) on platforms that support it.
#: Only takes effect when background_opacity is less than one. On
#: macOS, this will also control the blur radius (amount of blurring).
#: Setting it to too high a value will cause severe performance issues
#: and/or rendering artifacts. Usually, values up to 64 work well.
#: Note that this might cause performance issues, depending on how the
#: platform implements it, so use with care. Currently supported on
#: macOS and KDE.
background_blur 5

#: The edge to show the tab bar on, top or bottom.
tab_bar_edge top
