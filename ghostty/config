# The command to run, usually a shell. If this is not an absolute path, it'll
# be looked up in the `PATH`. If this is not set, a default will be looked up
# from your system. The rules for the default lookup are:
# 
#   * `SHELL` environment variable
# 
#   * `passwd` entry (user information)
# 
# This can contain additional arguments to run the command with. If additional
# arguments are provided, the command will be executed using `/bin/sh -c`.
# Ghostty does not do any shell command parsing.
# 
# If you're using the `ghostty` CLI there is also a shortcut to run a command
# with arguments directly: you can use the `-e` flag. For example: `ghostty -e
# fish --with --custom --args`. The `-e` flag automatically forces some
# other behaviors as well:
# 
#   * `gtk-single-instance=false` - This ensures that a new instance is
#     launched and the CLI args are respected.
# 
#   * `quit-after-last-window-closed=true` - This ensures that the Ghostty
#     process will exit when the command exits. Additionally, the
#     `quit-after-last-window-closed-delay` is unset.

# The following command checks if tmux is installed.
# If tmux is installed, it automatically attaches to an existing tmux session.
# If no tmux session exists, a new one is created.
# If tmux is not installed, it simply starts zsh without tmux.
#
# For this to work properly, you need to make sure that your shell is configured
# for homebrew, so you should have this line:
# eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
# In your ~/.zprofile file
# If you don't have that line, or if the file doesn't exist, run this:
# echo '' >>~/.zprofile && echo '# Configure shell for brew' >>~/.zprofile && echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >>~/.zprofile && eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
#
# This assumes you installed tmux through brew if using macos
# command = zsh --login -c "if command -v tmux >/dev/null 2>&1; then tmux attach || tmux; else zsh; fi"

# Horizontal window padding. This applies padding between the terminal cells
# and the left and right window borders. The value is in points, meaning that
# it will be scaled appropriately for screen DPI.
# 
# If this value is set too large, the screen will render nothing, because the
# grid will be completely squished by the padding. It is up to you as the user
# to pick a reasonable value. If you pick an unreasonable value, a warning
# will appear in the logs.
# 
# Changing this configuration at runtime will only affect new terminals, i.e.
# new windows, tabs, etc.
# 
# To set a different left and right padding, specify two numerical values
# separated by a comma. For example, `window-padding-x = 2,4` will set the
# left padding to 2 and the right padding to 4. If you want to set both
# paddings to the same value, you can use a single value. For example,
# `window-padding-x = 2` will set both paddings to 2.

# Valid values:
# 
#   * `true`
#   * `false` - windows won't have native decorations, i.e. titlebar and
#      borders. On macOS this also disables tabs and tab overview.
# 
# The "toggle_window_decoration" keybind action can be used to create
# a keybinding to toggle this setting at runtime.
# 
# Changing this configuration in your configuration and reloading will
# only affect new windows. Existing windows will not be affected.
# 
# macOS: To hide the titlebar without removing the native window borders
#        or rounded corners, use `macos-titlebar-style = hidden` instead.

# Toggle the "quick" terminal. The quick terminal is a terminal that
# appears on demand from a keybinding, often sliding in from a screen
# edge such as the top. This is useful for quick access to a terminal
# without having to open a new window or tab.
#
# When the quick terminal loses focus, it disappears. The terminal state
# is preserved between appearances, so you can always press the keybinding
# to bring it back up.
#
# The quick terminal has some limitations:
#
#   - It is a singleton; only one instance can exist at a time.
#   - It does not support tabs.
#   - It will not be restored when the application is restarted
#     (for systems that support window restoration).
#   - It supports fullscreen, but fullscreen will always be a non-native
#     fullscreen (macos-non-native-fullscreen = true). This only applies
#     to the quick terminal window. This is a requirement due to how
#     the quick rerminal is rendered.
#
# See the various configurations for the quick terminal in the
# configuration file to customize its behavior.
#
# `global:` - Make the keybind global. By default, keybinds only work
#  within Ghostty and under the right conditions (application focused,
#  sometimes terminal focused, etc.). If you want a keybind to work
#  globally across your system (i.e. even when Ghostty is not focused),
#  specify this prefix. This prefix implies `all:`. Note: this does not
#  work in all environments; see the additional notes below for more
#  information.

# If `true`, the *Option* key will be treated as *Alt*. This makes terminal

# sequences on macOS if you use them via the *Alt* key. You may set this to
# `false` to restore the macOS *Alt* key unicode sequences but this will break
# terminal sequences expecting *Alt* to work.
# 
# The values `left` or `right` enable this for the left or right *Option*
# key, respectively.
# 
# Note that if an *Option*-sequence doesn't produce a printable character, it
# will be treated as *Alt* regardless of this setting. (i.e. `alt+ctrl+a`).

# Customize the macOS app icon.
# 
# This only affects the icon that appears in the dock, application
# switcher, etc. This does not affect the icon in Finder because
# that is controlled by a hardcoded value in the signed application
# bundle and can't be changed at runtime. For more details on what
# exactly is affected, see the `NSApplication.icon` Apple documentation;
# that is the API that is being used to set the icon.
# 
# WARNING: The `custom-style` option is _experimental_. We may change
# the format of the custom styles in the future. We're still finalizing
# the exact layers and customization options that will be available.
# 
# Other caveats:
# 
#   * The icon in the update dialog will always be the official icon.
#     This is because the update dialog is managed through a
#     separate framework and cannot be customized without significant
#     effort.
# 
# Valid values:
# 
#  * `official` - Use the official Ghostty icon.
#  * `blueprint`, `chalkboard`, `microchip`, `glass`, `holographic`,
#    `paper`, `retro`, `xray` - Official variants of the Ghostty icon
#    hand-created by artists (no AI).
#  * `custom-style` - Use the official Ghostty icon but with custom
#    styles applied to various layers. The custom styles must be
#    specified using the additional `macos-icon`-prefixed configurations.
#    The `macos-icon-ghost-color` and `macos-icon-screen-color`
#    configurations are required for this style.

# The opacity level (opposite of transparency) of the background. A value of
# 1 is fully opaque and a value of 0 is fully transparent. A value less than 0
# or greater than 1 will be clamped to the nearest valid value.
# 
# On macOS, background opacity is disabled when the terminal enters native
# fullscreen. This is because the background becomes gray and it can cause
# widgets to show through which isn't generally desirable.
# 
# On macOS, changing this configuration requires restarting Ghostty completely.

# Whether to blur the background when `background-opacity` is less than 1.
# 
# Valid values are:
# 
#   * a nonnegative integer specifying the *blur intensity*
#   * `false`, equivalent to a blur intensity of 0
#   * `true`, equivalent to the default blur intensity of 20, which is
#     reasonable for a good looking blur. Higher blur intensities may
#     cause strange rendering and performance issues.
# 
# Supported on macOS and on some Linux desktop environments, including:
# 
#   * KDE Plasma (Wayland and X11)
# 
# Warning: the exact blur intensity is _ignored_ under KDE Plasma, and setting
# this setting to either `true` or any positive blur intensity value would
# achieve the same effect. The reason is that KWin, the window compositor
# powering Plasma, only has one global blur setting and does not allow
# applications to specify individual blur settings.
# 
# To configure KWin's global blur setting, open System Settings and go to
# "Apps & Windows" > "Window Management" > "Desktop Effects" and select the
# "Blur" plugin. If disabled, enable it by ticking the checkbox to the left.
# Then click on the "Configure" button and there will be two sliders that
# allow you to set background blur and noise intensities for all apps,
# including Ghostty.
# 
# All other Linux desktop environments are as of now unsupported. Users may
# need to set environment-specific settings and/or install third-party plugins
# in order to support background blur, as there isn't a unified interface for
# doing so.
background-blur = true

# The opacity level (opposite of transparency) of an unfocused split.
# Unfocused splits by default are slightly faded out to make it easier to see
# which split is focused. To disable this feature, set this value to 1.
# 
# A value of 1 is fully opaque and a value of 0 is fully transparent. Because
# "0" is not useful (it makes the window look very weird), the minimum value
# is 0.15. This value still looks weird but you can at least see what's going
# on. A value outside of the range 0.15 to 1 will be clamped to the nearest
# valid value.
